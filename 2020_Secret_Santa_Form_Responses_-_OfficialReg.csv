He knows he wants to fill a ‘healer’ role but he doesn’t know what class he wants to be (including but not limited to your standard fantasy cleric, priest, monk, paladin…etc). Maybe once he spots the perfect outfit, it’ll click.

Your task: 
Create an outfit for a wee kelpcat who wants to spec into ‘healing’.
-Tags are just for reference, you don't need to include all of them unless you feel like it
-Reposing is fine but definitely not necessary
-If your design only works on one version of the kelpcat, please use the evolved version.
-Please go for a ‘Level 1’/novice healer look. The kitty is not epic. The kitty barely knows how to apply a bandaid.
-Bonus points for clothing that is charmingly too big for a kitty!

shiny things are good. give them jewelry and filigree, however you want. maybe kelp themed if you want. also some golden kelp adornments (jewelry or real sea leaves or both, up to you).

don't overwhelm them though.

a background would be lovely! something like the golden aquarium background.  golden kelp would be cool, as would be some little golden fish silhouettes.

please keep the palette to the seashark palette. so the gold jewelry and kelp should be similar to the yellow on the seashark, and the blue water should be similar to the blue and green on the pet. doesn't have to be exact, but it should match but still be recognizable as the aquarium set. as accent colors (small fish, kelp, etc., just little details) , it's fine to use the reds in the aquarium set and the brighter blues in the seashark's eyes and jewels.

optional: throw in a repose. especially if it's more convenient (i know the seashark pose is Fun to accessorize). however you want to do it is up to you.

I would like a Thranduil-inspired accessory.

Thranduil Character Description:
Thranduil is an elven king from The Hobbit and is a cold and serious type with the arrogance and elegance befitting of an elf king. Unlike his flamboyant son Legolas (who likes to show off with stunning acrobatics), Thranduil has had many millennium to hone his skills to utmost efficiency; he wastes no energy on extravagant moves. Thranduil's wife died long ago, and it caused a grief so deep that he shut down the feelings of love and empathy. Overall, he is a methodical, arrogant, and cold-hearted character. That is very difficult to portray, so it is A-OK to skip over adding any expressions or body language / repose.

Pet:
I have no preference for a pet, evo or non-evo. As long as it's an obtainable pet (i.e. not a KS or Beta pet) it's all good. I think perhaps humanoid pets like the Gloomy Imp, Glass Harpy, or Spiral Imp would work well with the idea of an elven character, but I could definitely see animal-esque pets like the Flying Batfox, Bell Fox, or Pointed Grypon working just as well. Please feel free to choose a pet that gives you inspiration!","Body Markings/Patterns, Clothing, Metal/Armor, Spooky/Horror","What I would like to see:
A Shrowd-inspired accessory from the monster hunting game Dauntless. The Shrowd sports a purple/black color palette with sharp, glowing eyes, claw-like features and long, jagged feathers. I was personally imagining something like black, shadow-like armor with feather elements, but feel free to get creative with this dress-up! Wispy background elements, perhaps a shadow... anything.

Theme: Chinese outfits(hanfu) or silk. I would like some sort of asian/chinese-inspired cloth with a background element. Maybe some whisps/smoke or flowy silk if you feel comfortable doing it. Expression change is a plus but not required. Lots of artistic freedom here as I don't have any specific vision for it, just have fun and do your best with it!

Vibe: Ethereal/celestial, delicate/refined. If you choose Onyx Dragonlet, I'd also like a bit of a cool vibe to it. Some vibe inspiration, if you need it --

Extra Note: Ideally I have an accessory that I can be used on both the evo and non-evo, but this is not at all necessary and just something that I would love.
